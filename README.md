# financial-sentiment-analysis

In this repo, I've started to experiment with using text analysis, with specific application to news related to the financial markets. There are two methods used, the first uses the VADER text sentiment analyser, and the second uses FinBert.

Bert is a transformer (deep learning), which is primarily trained on, for example, Wikipedia articles. It learns by assigning words to randomly redacted spaces in text. Essentially, Bert learns how to speak like a human. What is awesome, is that Bert can be further extended. In further training Bert on numerous financial analyst reports, the transformer is now not only able to speak like a human, but can now speak like a trader! Hence, Bert becomes FinBert :).

I expect this work will likely feed into the architecture of an algorithmic trading startegy, which diversifies across technical analysis, fundamental analysis, time series modelling, ML, and market sentiment.
